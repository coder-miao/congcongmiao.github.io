I received the B.S. degree in communication engineering from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT) in 2015. In June 2020, I received the PhD degree in Computer Science under the supervision of Prof. Jilong Wang at Tsinghua University. Now, I am working as Research Scientist (full time) in Department of Network Platform, Tencent.

Note: I am always on the lookout for motivated students to do long-term research with me.
