abstract = {As the solitary inter-domain protocol, BGP plays an important role in today's Internet. Its failures threaten network stability and will usually result in large-scale packet losses. Thus, the non-stop routing (NSR) capability that protects inter-domain connectivity from being disrupted by various failures, is critical to any Autonomous System (AS) operator. Replicating the BGP and underlying TCP connection status is key to realizing NSR. But existing NSR solutions, which heavily rely on OS kernel modifications, have become impractical due to providers' adoption of virtualized network gateways for better scalability and manageability.In this paper, we tackle this problem by proposing TENSOR, which incorporates a novel kernel-modification-free replication design and lightweight architecture. More concretely, the kernel-modification-free replication design mitigates the reliance on OS kernel modification and hence allows the virtualization of the network gateway. Meanwhile, lightweight virtualization provides strong performance guarantees and improves system reliability. Moreover, TENSOR provides a solution to the split-brain problem that affects NSR solutions. Through extensive experiments, we show that TENSOR realizes NSR while bearing little overhead compared to open-source BGP implementations. Further, our two-year operational experience on a fleet of 400 servers controlling over 31,000 BGP peering connections demonstrates that TENSOR reduces the development, deployment, and maintenance costs significantly - at least by factors of 20, 5, and 10, respectively, while retaining the same SLA with the NSR-enabled routers.},

abstract = {The rising demand for WAN capacity driven by the rapid growth of inter-data center traffic poses new challenges for costly optical networks. Today cloud providers rely on fixed optical backbones, where all hardware devices operate on a rigid spectrum grid, leading to the waste of expensive optical resources and subpar performance in handling failures. In this paper, we introduce FlexWAN, a novel flexible WAN infrastructure designed to provision cost-effective WAN capacity while ensuring resilience to optical failures. FlexWAN achieves this by incorporating spacing-variable hardware at the optical layer, enabling the generated wavelength to optimize the utilization of limited spectrum resources for the WAN capacity. The configuration of spacing-variable hardware in a multi-vendor optical backbone presents challenges related to spectrum management. To address this, FlexWAN leverages a centralized controller to achieve coordinated control of network-wide optical devices in a vendor-agnostic manner. Moreover, the flexibility at the optical layer introduces new algorithmic problems. FlexWAN formulates the problem of provisioning WAN capacity with the goal of minimizing hardware costs. We evaluate the system performance in production and share insights from years of production experience. Compared to existing optical backbones, FlexWAN can save at least 57\% of transponders and reduce 36\% of spectrum usage while continuing to meet up to 8\texttimes{} the present-day demands using existing hardware and fiber deployments. FlexWAN further incorporates failure resilience that revives 15\% more bandwidth capacity in the overloaded optical backbone.},

abstract = {Trip recommendation is a significant and engaging location-based service that can help new tourists make more customized travel plans. It often attempts to suggest a sequence of points of interest (POIs) for a user who requests a personalized travel demand. Conventional methods either leverage the heuristic algorithms (e.g., dynamic programming) or statistical analysis (e.g., Markov models) to search or rank a POI sequence. These procedures may fail to capture the diversity of human needs and transitional regularities. They even provide recommendations that deviate from tourists’ real travel intention when the trip data is sparse. Although recent deep recursive models (e.g., RNN) are capable of alleviating these concerns, existing solutions hardly recognize the practical reality, such as the diversity of tourist demands, uncertainties in the trip generation, and the complex visiting preference. Inspired by the advance in deep learning, we introduce a novel self-supervised representation learning framework for trip recommendation — SelfTrip, aiming at tackling the aforementioned challenges. Specifically, we propose a two-step contrastive learning mechanism concerning the POI representation, as well as trip representation. Furthermore, we present four trip augmentation methods to capture the visiting uncertainties in trip planning. We evaluate our SelfTrip on four real-world datasets, and extensive results demonstrate the promising gain compared with several cutting-edge benchmarks, e.g., up to 4% and 10% improvements on Osaka regarding F1 and pair-F1.}

abstract = {Human mobility prediction is an important task in the field of spatiotemporal sequential data mining and urban computing. Despite the extensive work on mining human mobility behavior, little attention was paid to the problem of successive mobility prediction. The state-of-the-art methods of human mobility prediction are mainly based on supervised learning. To achieve higher predictability and adapt well to the successive mobility prediction, there are four key challenges: 1) disability to the circumstance that the optimizing target is discrete-continuous hybrid and non-differentiable. In our work, we assume that the user's demands are always multi-targeted and can be modeled as a discrete-continuous hybrid function; 2) difficulty to alter the recommendation strategy flexibly according to the changes in user needs in real scenarios; 3) error propagation and exposure bias issues when predicting multiple points in successive mobility prediction; 4) cannot interactively explore user's potential interest that does not appear in the history. While previous methods met these difficulties, reinforcement learning (RL) is an intuitive answer for this task to settle these issues. We innovatively introduce RL to the successive prediction task. In this paper, we formulate this problem as a Markov Decision Process. We further propose a framework - RLMob to solve our problem. A simulated environment is carefully designed. An actor-critic framework with an instance of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is applied to adapt to our scene with a large state space. Experiments show that on the task, the performance of our approach is consistently superior to that of the compared approaches.},

abstract = {Predicting crowd flows is crucial for urban planning, traffic management and public safety. However, predicting crowd flows is not trivial because of three challenges: 1) highly heterogeneous mobility data collected by various services; 2) complex spatio-temporal correlations of crowd flows, including multi-scale spatial correlations along with non-linear temporal correlations. 3) diversity in long-term temporal patterns. To tackle these challenges, we proposed an end-to-end architecture, called pyramid dilated spatial-temporal network (PDSTN), to effectively learn spatial-temporal representations of crowd flows with a novel attention mechanism. Specifically, PDSTN employs the ConvLSTM structure to identify complex features that capture spatial-temporal correlations simultaneously, and then stacks multiple ConvLSTM units for deeper feature extraction. For further improving the spatial learning ability, a pyramid dilated residual network is introduced by adopting several dilated residual ConvLSTM networks to extract multi-scale spatial information. In addition, a novel attention mechanism, which considers both long-term periodicity and the shift in periodicity, is designed to study diverse temporal patterns. Extensive experiments were conducted on three highly heterogeneous real-world mobility datasets to illustrate the effectiveness of PDSTN beyond the state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, PDSTN provides intuitive interpretation into the prediction.},
