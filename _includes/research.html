<h2><strong>Research</strong></h2>
<p>My research is poised at the cutting edge of network systems design, with a focus on achieving high service-level objectives (SLOs) in the dynamic, complex environments of cloud and wide area networks. My work spans four key approaches: leveraging high-precision data for optical network failure prediction, re-architecting WAN infrastructure for resource optimization, innovating in network function virtualization to ensure BGP non-stop routing, and applying machine learning models to predict network demands and behaviors. These groundbreaking strategies aim to bridge the growing gap between customer demands and provider capabilities, offering robust, cost-effective solutions that maintain performance sustainability even as new cloud services proliferate. With significant contributions to the fields of network telemetry, WAN capacity provisioning, virtualization, and predictive modeling, My research has already been integrated into industry practices, garnering recognition and deployment in major tech corporations and esteemed academic publications.
